# Analyzing-and-Forecasting-data-with-R

New York City is full of urban wildlife, and rats are one of the city’s most infamous animal mascots. Rats in NYC are plentiful, but they also deliver food, so they’re useful too. NYC keeps incredibly detailed data regarding animal sightings, including rats, and it makes this data publicly available.

For this project, we will use R and ggplot2 to tell an interesting story hidden in the data.
